- As a user, I want to be able to vote on images that I find appealing, so that I only see advertisements for products that I find enticing in the BusMall pamphlets.

- As a researcher, I want to retrieve itemized and overall feedback from user voting, so that I have a good idea of which items are the most popular.
- As a researcher, I want users to see as many of the images as possible in 25 rounds, so that the end users are able to vote on as many of our offerings as possible.
- As a researcher, I want the image sets to be randomly generated, and for 3 images to be shown at once, so that the voting is more fair and indicative of how our pamphlets will be viewed.
- As a researcher, I want each image to be the same dimensions so that none stand out from the others, so that the voting is more fair.
